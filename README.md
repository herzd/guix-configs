# guix-configs
some experimental GNU Guix configurations to have by my hand. if at all, not to be applied without adaption and careful inspection!

the code here runs on a fujitsu lifebook a557 laptop connected via LAN to a switch. The processor is an 'Intel® Core™ i5-7200U CPU @ 2.50GHz × 4', the built-in graphics card is a 'Mesa Intel® HD Graphics 620 (KBL GT2)', and '7,7 GiB' RAM as reported by GNOME.
